# Multi Referral System with reward point app for Users

The objective of this project is to design and develop a multi-referral system that rewards users for referring others using a hierarchical point distribution structure. Upon registration through a referral code, users (referrers) and up to 9 uplines will receive reward points. The system aims to drive user engagement, incentivize network growth, and provide transparent tracking of referrals and rewards. The platform will also include admin management for monitoring and ensuring smooth operation.
